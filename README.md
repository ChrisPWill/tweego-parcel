# What is this?

Development boilerplate including:

- [tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego) - [Twine](https://twinery.org/)/Twee compiler
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - a simple low config bundler
- A default image and scss file to demonstrate inclusion of media
- A macro defined in typescript

# Getting started

This was set up using yarn and node v22. If you use nix, the easiest way to
get started is to just run `nix develop` and then `yarn install`.

The rest can be read from `package.json` - for example, `yarn start` compiles
the project to the `/out` directory.
